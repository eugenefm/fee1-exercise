Hey there!

Thank you so much for taking the time to check this out — we appreciate your
time.

We'd like you to show us a bit of what you can do by completing a short
exercise. It's nothing major, and should not take you long, but we'd like to give
you room to blow us away. We require that you make a submission within a
specific time frame, whilst leaving you room to improve on the first
submission over an extended period. Just to be clear, you do not have to spend
too much time on it. We just want you to deliver simple, clean and, idomatic code
in a well organized form.

## How to do the exercise

Fork this repository to your github profile, do the exercise and then send us a
pull request.

You can have as many commits as you would like, but after completing the exercise to 
our basic specifications, commit your code with the commit message:

"``Submission1``"

This would allow us know which one of the commits you want to be evaluated on.
You should do this by noon on Saturday.

After this, if you want to show us more of what you can do by improving on your
first submission, work on it some more and then send us another pull
request. You can do this any time before midnight on Sunday. We will not
consider any submission after midnight on Sunday.

## The Exercise
We'd like you to build this here page:

![image description](brief/page-mockup.png)

You'll find all the mockups and assets for it in the [brief](brief)
folder. We provide mockups in both pdf and png formats

The dropdown input at the top of the page is the interactive part of the page. So be sure to look at
[brief/dropdown-style-guide.png](brief/dropdown-style-guide.png) for guidelines
on how it needs to work and look.

Also, the image at the center of the page should change when an item in the dropdown is selected.
For this, there are 5 images in the [brief/Assets/browser-images](brief/Assets/browser-images).
So the dropdown should have 5 options labeled:
- Dog with shades
- Donuts
- Pineapple Vacation
- Pizza and Bears
- Storm Trooper 

Put your code in the folder named ``src`` So, your HTML code should be in the
file ``src/index.html``. Be sure to organize your javascript code and assets
under that folder such that the project can be run as a static website from the
``src`` folder. Do take pains to separate markup, style and scripts into separate files. 

We have provided the assets you need for the page in the [brief/assets] folder.

# Key specifications and constraints

- Do *NOT* use a framework for this exercise. Your code must be written in plain
    Javascript and CSS. That includes the layout system — we suggest you
    explore CSS flex box, or a CSS grid system you implement yourself.
- Do not edit the package.json file in this folder

# Other considerations
- The page should be a fixed 960px wide. i.e it should at least be  built for desktop,
- Be sure to use a clear convention  like [BEM](http://getbem.com/naming/) for
    your CSS
- Adopt a consistent Javascript code style.
- If there is any thing you would want us to know about your work write it in a file called ``implementation.md``

# Asking Questions

We are happy to answer questions but would prefer that you make assumptions and move forward. Later, if asked, stand by your choices and defend them. If you do choose to ask questions, please send an email to veteran@en-powered.com eh!
