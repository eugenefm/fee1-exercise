# Notes

## Image Assets

The provided images assets have a transparent margin included with them, they need to be replaced so that a box shadow can appropriately be applied to the image.

## Custom Dropdown

I have styled the the main select input but not the dropdown box.

I have built custom dropdown boxes before for large consumer websites, and to create one with cross-browser support while maintaining accessibility is a large task even with the help of a modern framework.

To implement it properly would take more time than I am willing to invest in this exercise. Instead, I'm happy to discuss the challenges of building a custom box during a technical interview.
